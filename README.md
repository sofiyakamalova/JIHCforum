The creation of the JIHC forum application will allow students, 
teachers and high school students to overcome difficulties in understanding lessons, 
completing homework, choosing a mentor and determining their future profession 
through active interaction and knowledge sharing within the application platform. 
The app will create a supportive environment where users can seek help, 
receive guidance from experienced people, 
and access relevant information to make informed decisions about their studies and future career plans. 
This will eventually lead to improved academic performance, increased engagement, and better career planning among students.
